labstats_plot can plot data for one host, or average data from all hosts

userlogger plots average data across 1 lab

Maybe these can be combined into one script?

TODO: finish plotting functions of userlogger script. So far, it will print the data it collects, but does not plot it. See labstats_plot for example on how to plot data with gnuplot (may not be the best way).
